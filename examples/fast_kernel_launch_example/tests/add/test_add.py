def test_add_interface_exist():
    """
    Test that the 'ascend_ops.add' operator is present in torch.ops.
    This existence test asserts that the custom operator registered under the
    'ascend_ops' namespace is discoverable from Python via torch.ops.ascend_ops.add.
    It does not exercise operator functionality — only that the Python binding
    and registration are available.
    Rationale:
    The presence of this test guards against a common failure mode where an
    operator is implemented and registered in C++/ATen but is not exposed to
    the Python torch.ops namespace due to mismatches between the PyTorch
    operator schema and the C++ registration signature (argument names, types,
    or overloads). Such schema/signature inconsistencies can cause the
    operator to be hidden or not exported to Python, breaking consumers that
    expect to call torch.ops.ascend_ops.add. This test will fail loudly if the
    binding is missing, prompting investigation into schema/registration issues.
    """
    # This test specifically protects against discrepancies between the
    # PyTorch operator schema and the C++ signature/registration that can
    # prevent the operator from being visible in torch.ops.ascend_ops.
