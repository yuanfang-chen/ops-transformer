    Reference implementation of the paged QUEST block selection operator
    Selects the top-k important KV blocks based on approximate attention scores.

    Input:
        query - fp16 tensor of shape (batch_size, num_heads, head_dim)
        maxblocks - fp16 tensor of shape (num_meta_blocks, block_size, num_kv_heads, head_dim)
        minblocks - fp16 tensor of shape (num_meta_blocks, block_size, num_kv_heads, head_dim)
        metadata_block_tables - int32 tensor of shape (batch_size, mmbpr)
        seq_lens - int32 tensor of shape (batch_size)
        k - integer specifying how many block-indices to return for each kv-head

    Algorithm steps:
    1. For every batch, reduce-mean the query tensor across num_heads dimension 
        such that every group of num_heads/num_kv_heads vectors of shape head_dim are reduced to one vector
        of shape head_dim denotes as "grouped_query[b,n]".
    2. For each batch b and KV-head n:
        2.1. Determine how many metadata blocks are valid for this request: 
             num_valid_blocks = floor_div(seq_lens[b], block_size * block_size)
        2.2. For each valid metadata block:
             - Get the block metadata from maxblocks and minblocks
             - Calculate block scores using the same method as non-paged version
        2.3. Find the top-k indices across all valid blocks
    3. Return selected_indices
