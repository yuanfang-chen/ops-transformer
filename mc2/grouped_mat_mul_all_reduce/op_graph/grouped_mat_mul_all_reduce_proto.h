/**
* @brief Function GroupedMatMulAllReduce. This op computes multi groups of matmuls on multi-cards environment.

* @par Inputs:
* @li x: A Tensor List, contains all left matrixs of inputs for matmuls. For each tensor, the data type of elements supports float16 or bfloat16; the format supports ND. The maximum length allowed is 64.
* 32B-aligned size of each dim should be smaller than 2147483647. The size of inner axis should be smaller than 65536.
* @li weight: A Tensor List of weight, contains all right matrixs of inputs for matmul. For each tensor, the data type of elements supports float16 or bfloat16; the format supports ND. The maximum length allowed is 64.
* 32B-aligned size of each dim should be smaller than 2147483647. The size of inner axis should be smaller than 65536.
* @li bias: A Tensor List of bias, contains all bias of inputs for matmul. For each tensor, the data type of elements supports float16 or float32; the format supports ND. The maximum length allowed is 64.
* @li group_list: a Tensor, indicates M-axis distributation of groups of matmuls for inputs and outputs.
* Data type of elements is int64. Format: ND. The maximum length allowed is 64.

* @par Attributes:
* @li splitItem: An int64, indicates whether do tensor split for inputs and outputs.
* 0: no split for inputs and outputs; 1: inputs need tensor split; 2: outputs need tensor split;
* 3: both inputs and outputs need tensor split. Default value is 0.
* @li group: A string. A required String identifying the group of ranks.
* @li reduceOp: A string. A required string identifying the reduction operation to
 perform. support "sum".
* @li commTurn: An int64. Number of communications with AICPU. Default: 0.

* @par Outputs:
* y: A Tensor List, contains all result of groups of matmuls. For each tensor,
* the data type of elements supports float16 or bfloat16; the format supports ND. The maximum length allowed is 64.

* @attention Constraints:
* Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
