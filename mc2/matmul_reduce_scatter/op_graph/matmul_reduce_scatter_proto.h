/**
* @brief Fusion op of matmul and reduce scatter.
* @par Inputs:
* three inputs, including:
* @li x1: A matrix Tensor. The type support float16, bfloat16. The format supports ND. The x1 only supports 2 dimensions in current version, for example (M, K). The x1 doesn't support transposed.
* @li x2: A matrix Tensor. The type support float16, bfloat16. The x2 only supports 2 dimensions in current version, for example (K, N). The x2 supports transposed and non-transposed.
  The K value in x2 should be same as the K value in x1 when x2 is non-transposed, and the K value should be in range [256, 65535).
* @li bias: A matrix Tensor. The type support float16, bfloat16. The format supports ND. The current version does not support the scenario where bias is not 0.\n
*
* @par Attributes:
* @li group: A string. A required string identifying the group of ranks participating in the op.
* @li reduce_op: A string. A required string identifying the reduction operation to perform. Default: "sum".
* @li is_trans_a: A bool. If True, changes the shape of "x1" from [K, M] to [M, K] before multiplication. Default: false.
* @li is_trans_b: A bool. If True, changes the shape of "x2" from [N, K] to [K, N] before multiplication. Default: false.
* @li comm_turn: An int. Number of communications with AICPU. Default: 0. The comm_turn only supports 0 in current version.
* @li rank_size: An int. Number of ranks in the group. Default: 0. \n
  The Atlas A2 Training Series Product/Atlas 800I A2 Inference Product/A200I A2 Box Heterogeneous Component support 2, 4, 8. \n
  The Atlas A3 Training Series Product/Atlas A3 Inference Series Product support 2, 4, 8, 16. \n
*
* @par Outputs:
* y: A matrix Tensor. The type support float16, bfloat16. The format supports ND. The y is 2 dimensions, for example (M/rank_size, N).\n
