 *

 * [Bkv,1,1,Dk]. Format: ND.
 * @li sin: A tensor, from position embedding. Its type is consistent with kv. Its shape is [Bkv,1,Skv,Dk] or
 * [Bkv,1,1,Dk]. The shape of sin should be consistent with that of cos. Format: ND.
 * @li index: A tensor. The type support int64. When the cache_mode is Norm, its shape is [Bkv,Skv]. When the cache_mode
 * is PA_BNSD or PA_NZ, its shape is [Bkv*Skv]. When the cache_mode is PA_BLK_BNSD or PA_BLK_NZ, its shape is
 * [Bkv*ceil_div(Skv,BlockSize)]. Format: ND.
 * @li k_cache: A tensor. Its type is consistent with kv or int8. When the cache_mode is in PA scenario(cahce_mode is
 * PA_BNSD, PA_NZ, PA_BLK_BNSD or PA_BLK_NZ), its shape is [BlockNum,BlockSize,N,Dk]. When the cache_mode is Norm, its
 * shape is [Bcache,N,Scache,Dk]. Format: ND.
 * @li ckv_cache: A tensor. Its type is consistent with kv or int8. When the cache_mode is in PA scenario, its shape is
 * [BlockNum,BlockSize,N,Dv]. When the cache_mode is Norm, its shape is [Bcache,N,Scache,Dv]. Format: ND.
 * @li k_rope_scale: A tensor. The type support float32. This input parameter is required when the data type of k_cache
 * is int8. Its shape can be [N,Dk], [Dk,] or [1,]. Format: ND.
 * @li c_kv_scale: A tensor. The type support float32. This input parameter is required when the data type of ckv_cache
 * is int8. Its shape can be [N,Dv], [Dv,] or [1,]. Format: ND.
 * @li k_rope_offset: A tensor. The type support float32. When the data type of k_cache is int8 and the corresponding
 * input exists with the quantization scenario being asymmetric quantization, this parameter input is required. Its
 * shape can be [N,Dk], [Dk,] or [1,]. Format: ND.
 * @li c_kv_offset: A tensor. The type support float32. When the data type of ckv_cache is int8 and the corresponding
 * input exists with the quantization scenario being asymmetric quantization, this parameter input is required. Its
 * shape can be [N,Dk], [Dk,] or [1,]. Format: ND.
 *
 * @par Outputs:
 * @li k_cache: A tensor. Its type is consistent with kv or int8. When the cache_mode is in PA scenario, its shape is
 * [BlockNum,BlockSize,N,Dk]. When the cache_mode is Norm, its shape is [Bcache,N,Scache,Dk]. Format: ND.
 * @li ckv_cache: A tensor. Its type is consistent with kv or int8. When the cache_mode is in PA scenario, its shape is
 * [BlockNum,BlockSize,N,Dv]. When the cache_mode is Norm, its shape is [Bcache,N,Scache,Dv]. Format: ND.
 * @li k_rope: A tensor. Its type is consistent with kv. If is_output_kv is true, this parameter output is required.
 * Its shape is [Bkv,N,Skv,Dk]. Format: ND.
 * @li c_kv: A tensor. Its type is consistent with kv. If is_output_kv is true, this parameter output is required.
 * Its shape is [Bkv,N,Skv,Dv]. Format: ND.
 *
 * @par Attributes:
 * @li epsilon: A float32. The epsilon value for RMSNorm. Default: 1e-5.
 * @li cache_mode: A string. The cache dtype. There are five types：Norm, PA_BNSD, PA_NZ, PA_BLK_BNSD and PA_BLK_NZ.
 * Default: Norm.
 * @li is_output_kv: A bool. Control whether k_rope and c_kv are output. If it is true, then k_rope and c_kv need to be
 * output. If it is false, then k_rope and c_kv do not need to be output. Default: false.
 *
 * @attention Constraints:
 * @li The shape format description in the parameter description:
 *     - Bkv represents the batch size of the input kv, and Skv represents the sequence length of the input kv. The
 *     size is determined by the user's input scenario and has no explicit restrictions.
 *     - N is the head number of the input kv. This operator is strongly related to the DeepSeekV3 network structure
 *     and only supports scenarios where N=1. There are no scenarios where N is not 1.
 *     - D is the head dim of the input kv. The data Dv required for rms norm calculation and the data Dk required
 *     for rope calculation are split from the D of the input kv. Therefore, the sizes of Dk and Dv must satisfy
 *     Dk+Dv=D. Meanwhile, Dk must comply with the rope rules. According to the rope rule, Dk is an even number.
 *     If cache_mode is an NZ scenario(cahce_mode is PA_NZ or PA_BLK_NZ), Dk and Dv need to be 32B aligned.
 *     - If cache_mode is a PA scenario, the BlockSize needs to be 32B aligned.
 *     - Regarding the above-mentioned 32B alignment situation, the alignment value is determined by the data type
 *     of the cache. Take BlockSize as an example. If the data type of the cache is int8, then BlockSize%32=0 is
 *     required. If the data type of the cache is flaot16, then BlockSize%16=0 is required.
 *     - Bcache is the batch size of the input cache, and Scache is the sequence length of the input cache. The size
 *     is input by the user.
 *     - BlockNum is the number of memory blocks written to the cache, and its size is determined by the user's input
 *     scenario without any definite limit.
 * @li The index-related constraints:
 *     - When cache_mode is Norm, the shape is [Bkv,Skv], and the value range of index must be [-1,Scache).
 *     Under different Bkv. The values can be repeated.
 *     - When cache_mode is PA_BNSD or PA_NZ, the shape is [Bkv*Skv], and the value range of the index must be
 *     [-1,BlockNum*BlockSize). The values cannot be repeated.
 *     - When cache_mode is PA_BLK_BSND and PA_BLK_NZ, the shape is [Bkv*ceil div(Skv,BlockSize)]. The value
 *     range of index should be [-1,BlockNum*BlockSize). The values of value/BlockSize cannot be repeated.
 *
 * @par Restrictions:
 * Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS EXPERIMENTAL. Please do not use.
