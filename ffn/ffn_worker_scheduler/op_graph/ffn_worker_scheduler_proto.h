*@brief Data Scanning Operator for the FFN Side in Decoupled Attention-FFN Deployment Scenarios，This operator polls data from AttentionToFFN to confirm its readiness state.
*@par Inputs:
*@li  schedule_context: A tensor. The type support int8. Its shape must be 1D (1024). Format: ND

*@par Attributes
*@li sync_group_size: Sessions handled per group, with a default value of 1. The type support int32.
*@li execute_mode: Kernel execution mode. Currently only supports value 0. The type support int32.

*@par Outputs:
*schedule_context: A ND Tensor that holds the new value of schedule_context after the value has been assigned.
*Has the same shape and dtype and format as the input "schedule_context". \n
