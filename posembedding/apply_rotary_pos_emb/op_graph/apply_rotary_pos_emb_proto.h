/**
 * @brief Apply rotary position embedding.
 * @par Inputs:
 * @li query: A tensor for transformer query. Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16.
 * @li key: A tensor for transformer key. Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16.
 * @li cos: A tensor for rotary position embedding cos. Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16.
 * @li sin: A tensor for rotary position embedding sin. Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16.
 * @par Attributes:
 * @li layout: Optional.Explanation input format. 1-"BSND" 2-"SBND" 3-"BNSD". Defaults to 1.
 * @li rotary_mode: Optional.Explanation rotary mode. Support "half","interleave","quarter". Defaults to "half".
 * @par Outputs:
 * @li query: A tensor for transformer query. Has the same shape as "query".
 * @li key: A tensor for transformer key. Has the same shape as "key".
 * @attention Constraints:
 * @li Inputs  tensor of query, key, cos, sin must be 4D.
 * @li query, key must be the same except for the N dimension, the shape of sin and cos must be the same.
 * @li The B dimension of cos and sin must be consistent with query and key or equal to 1.
 * @li The S dimension of query, key, sin, cos must be the same.
 * @li The N dimension of cos and sin must be equal to 1.
 * @li The D dimension of query, key, sin, cos must be the same and not greater than 1024.
 * @li The dtype of input tensor query, key, sin, cos must be the same.
 * @li When the rotary_mode is "half" or "interleave", the D dimension must be divisible by 2.
 * when the rotary_mode is "quarter", the D dimension must be divisible by 4
 * @li Atlas Inference Series Product and Atlas Trainning Series Product:
    - support types: float16, float32.
    - support layout: not support.
    - support rotary_mode: not support.
 * @li Atlas A2 Training Series Product/ Atlas 800I A2 Inference Product and Atlas A3 Training Series Product:
